# Installing FFB6D in Cuda 11.3
The original FFB6D codes were built on Cuda 10.x and opencv 3.x. System with more recent RTX cards can only run with Cuda 11.x

Cuda 10.2: Support Compute capability <= 7.5 <br/>
Cuda 11.0: Support Compute capability <= 8.0 <br/>
Cuda 11.3: Support Compute capability <= 8.6 <br/>

GPU cards compute capability: <br/>
RTX 3090, 3080, 3070: Compute capability 8.6 <br/>
RTX 2080 Ti: Compute capability 7.5 <br/>
GTX 1080 Ti: Conpute capability 6.1 <br/>

Our new server is already installed with Cuda 11.3 but this is to record the step to install cuda 11.3 on the system.
You can skip these instructions for installing cuda 11.3 for the system
## Installing Cuda 11.3 and nvidia display drivers
```
sudo apt purge -y 'nvidia-*'
sudo apt autoremove
```
Installing nvidia driver:
```
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-470 #version 470
```

## Installing FFB6D

```
git clone https://github.com/ethnhe/FFB6D
cd FFB6D
conda create -n ffb6d python=3.7
conda activate ffb6d
pip3 install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html
```
Create a file requirement_new.txt with the following content:
```
h5py

```

```
pip install -r requirement_new.txt
```
## Installing Opencv 3.x
OpenCV need to be compilted as this is required latter when other packages require compiling with the opencv header. <br/>
The "make install" will install the headers and libraries to the conda system and also the python cv2 package 
```
wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/3.4.16.zip
unzip 3.4.16.zip
rm 3.4.16.zip
wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/refs/tags/3.4.16.zip
unzip 3.4.16.zip
rm 3.4.16.zip
cd opencv-3.4.16
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX -D PYTHON3_LIBRARY=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.7 -D PYTHON3_INCLUDE_DIR=$CONDA_PREFIX/include/python3.7m -D PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE=$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/python -D PYTHON3_PACKAGES_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/python3.7/site-packages -D WITH_TBB=ON -D ENABLE_FAST_MATH=1 -D CUDA_FAST_MATH=1 -D WITH_CUBLAS=1 -D WITH_CUDA=ON -D BUILD_opencv_cudacodec=OFF -D WITH_CUDNN=ON -D OPENCV_DNN_CUDA=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D WITH_QT=OFF -D WITH_OPENGL=ON -D WITH_GSTREAMER=ON -D OPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON -D OPENCV_PC_FILE_NAME=opencv.pc -D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib-3.4.16/modules -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=OFF -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=OFF -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF ..

make -j8
make install
```
## Install apex
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
cd apex
export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="7.0;7.5;8.0;8.6"
python setup.py install --cuda_ext --cpp_ext
cd ..

```
## Install normal speed
Install normalSpeed, a fast and light-weight normal map estimator. This will require opencv headers:
```
git clone https://github.com/hfutcgncas/normalSpeed.git
cd normalSpeed/normalSpeed
python3 setup.py install --user
cd ..
```
## Compile RandLA-Net operators:
```
cd ffb6d/models/RandLA/
sh compile_op.sh
```
## FFB6D codes update
The original codes cant run after the first epouch because of tensorboardx problem.
Please replace line 418 in the file ffb6d/train_lm.py (writer.add_scalars('val_acc', acc_dict, it)) with:

```
          for i,val in enumerate(acc_dict):
                writer.add_scalar(tag='Checking range', scalar_value=acc_dict[val][i], global_step=i)
```

## Training with LineMod

### Generate rendered and Fused data for LineMod datasets
The raster triangle codes has been downloaded to /home/datasets/raster_triangle. Compile the rastertriangle_so.sh by modifying the correct library and include directory

Generate the  rendered and fused data by:
E.g for 'ape'
```
python3 rgbd_renderer.py --cls ape --render_num 70000
python3 fuse.py --cls ape --fuse_num 10000
```
Note there are following objects to generate and train:
```
    'ape': 1,
    'benchvise': 2,
    'cam': 4,
    'can': 5,
    'cat': 6,
    'driller': 8,
    'duck': 9,
    'eggbox': 10,
    'glue': 11,
    'holepuncher': 12,
    'iron': 13,
    'lamp': 14,
    'phone': 15,
```
Finally, training using the following commands:

```
cd ffb6d
n_gpu=4
cls='ape'
python3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$n_gpu train_lm.py --gpus=$n_gpu --cls=$cls
```
Make sure there is no warning that apex is not compiled with --cuda_ext option, otherwise pip uninstall apex and compile apex again
